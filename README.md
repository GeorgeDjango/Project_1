## Description

---

This website acts as a professional working website for my own business as a freelance musician and music tutor.

On the 'Home' page, I wanted to give the reader/viewer a brief explanation as to who I am straight away, with a picture of myself, my development as a professional musician, the services I offer, as well as a video of myself playing bass.

I wanted the website to have very user friendly and obvious layout, meaning that it wasn't complicated, and very simple to move to each section regardless of which device you'd be viewing from.

On the second tab labelled 'Prices', the user is able to find the prices for lessons as well as prices for hiring me as a session musician.

The next tab 'Contact' you can find the details for contacting me as well as where the studios are that I teach from.

Here you can also find two buttons which, depending on the device, will auto fill an email to send, or call me, if they don't fancy calling me they can also find a form to fill out, where they can highlight any queries they may have, which will send their details to me so I can contact them.

On the tab 'Projects', they will also be able to view my past and current projects that I have worked on, which hopefully will give them an idea of what kind of music I'm currently making.

At the bottom my social media pages can be seen, which will be opened when clicked.


## Features:


- All tabs:
-- Tab layout - The page is completely made using a tab system in which the user can access the four different sections with ease.
-- Links to social media - In the footer I have links to relevent social media
