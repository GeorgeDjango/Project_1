## Description

---

This website acts as a professional working website for my own business as a freelance musician and music tutor.

I wanted to give the reader/viewer a brief explanation as to who I am, my experiences as a musician as well as what services I can provide. On this website they should be able to find the prices for lessons and sessions, where I can do private lessons and my contact details.


There are two buttons which, depending on the device, will auto fill an email to send, or call me, if they don't fancy calling me they can also find a form to fill out which eventually will send their details to me so I can contact them.

On this site, they will also be able to view my past and current projects that I have worked on, which hopefully will give them an idea of what kind of music I'm currently working on.

At the bottom my social media pages can be seen, which will be opened when clicked.
